Surrounded by walls
Trapped in these halls
Doomed until everyone falls

All they say is "Stay at Home"
Yet my heart still wants to roam
And all I can do is stay at home

"Safer at Home," they said
"Think of the Kids," they said
"We want you to be safe - that's it"
Or maybe, we just want to control you and your sh*t.
